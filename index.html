    We operate a local Veterinary Clinic. Our current systems are being used on Google Sheets, which is neither all that effective nor secure. We wish to update our system utilizing a database to increase productivity and decrease errors and general confusion. 
    Our mission is to create a database system for our veterinarian clinic. This database system will be utilized to create a comprehensive and efficient software solution that improves the operations of the vet clinic. The database system aims to organize and streamline various processes, including appointment scheduling, medical record management, billing, and reporting. The utilization of this database system will lead to higher operational efficiency, improved performance for the clinic, increased customer satisfaction and enhanced care for our animal patients.
